# Crypto API Parser


This project works with the [CryptingUp](https://cryptingup.com/apidoc/#api-url) API




Using the API functionality, I wrote a program using the C# language, the .NET platform, and WPF technology

## The functionality of the program:

• The main page shows the top N currencies by the popularity in a given market (or the top 10 currencies returned by the API).

• Ability to view detailed information about the currency: price, volume, price change, on which markets it can be purchased, and at what price

• Ability to go to the currency page on the market

• Ability to search currency by name or code

• Conversion of one currency into another

### An example of the program

You only need Visual Studio (or any other code editor) to use the app. You don't need to download additional plugins, and you can start working right away. The program interface is as simple as possible, so any user will be able to understand its functionality and immediately start working
